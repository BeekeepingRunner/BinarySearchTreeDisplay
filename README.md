# BinarySearchTreeDisplay
I've created displayTreeRecursive() method along with other "helper" methods to display a binary search tree on a console in Java.
Significant part of the code for BST, and Node class comes from an udemy course "Practical Data Structures & Algorithms in Java + HW", by Imtiaz Ahmad.
